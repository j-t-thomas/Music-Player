# Music-Player: https://j-t-thomas.github.io/Music-Player/
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript - A simple single page music player that has forward and backward function, as well as skipping to a time within each song.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on using JavaScript techniques to create working button elements as well as using animations in CSS for the rotating disk.

## Optimizations

I want to update this app by using an API for the music instead of manually adding music from my computer, as adding it manually limits the number of songs that can be played. I also want to add the ability to search for songs and see lyrics, and creating a more visually pleasing interface with more functionality using JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned:

During the build of this app, I learned to stay resilient in the troubleshooting process and reaching out for help when needed.
